# BWFWAVrename
An ongoing project to help us see usable audio track information on our timelines when using Avid Media Composer.

Please visit https://www.lextv.uk/bwfwavrename/ for further information regarding useage and implementation.

Code is written in Python and uses a modification of the WAVE module to hack the BWF wave files. Only the iXML header and filenames are modified, the BWF header is left unmodified. While the project currently works with available versions of Media Composer, there's no guarantee that import procedures may change in future versions and problems may occur.

Check https://github.com/lexathon/BWFWAVrename/tree/main/builds for latest executables for mac and pc.
